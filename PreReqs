#Create an Azure AD Application that has appropriate Graph API permissions for data that you'd like to visualise in SquaredUp. 
 The following seem to cover most eventualites and are all read-only:
    Application.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Group.Read.All, Organization.Read.All, ServiceHealth.Read.All, ServiceMessage.Read.All, User.Read.All
 You'll need the ClientId and TenantId. 
 You'll also need to upload a certificate from your SquaredUp webserver.

#Create a PowerShell profile in SquaredUp for each Tenant you want to connect to.
 This is where you can store your connection to MgGraph for each Tenant so that it's not visible in SquaredUp to end-users:
    # Connect to the M365 Tenant
      Connect-MgGraph -ClientId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 -TenantId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 -CertificateThumbrint 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

#Once you have the above, you can create dashboards with PowerShell tiles to pull data on demand from Microsoft Graph using Graph PowerShell.
